## Key Features

  - **AI-Powered Resume Analysis:** Upload a `.pdf` or `.docx` resume, or paste text to have your skills and experience intelligently extracted.
  - **Intelligent Job Matching:** Go beyond keywords with AI that understands the context of your skills to match you with the best-fitting roles.
  - **Skill Gap Identification:** Clearly see which skills are required for a target job that you don't currently have.
  - **Personalized Learning Paths:** Receive a custom, step-by-step learning plan generated by GPT, with recommendations for courses, tutorials, and certifications.

## Technology Stack

The application is built using a modern, scalable, multi-service architecture.

  - **Frontend (`client`):**

      - Framework: **Next.js** (React)
      - Language: **TypeScript**
      - UI: **Shadcn UI**
      - Styling: **Tailwind CSS**
      - Authentication: **NextAuth.js**

  - **Backend (`server`):**

      - Framework: **NestJS** (Node.js)
      - Language: **TypeScript**
      - ORM: **TypeORM**
      - Database Communication: **pg**

  - **AI Service (`ai-service`):**

      - Framework: **FastAPI**
      - Language: **Python**
      - NLP: **SpaCy**
      - LLM Integration: **OpenAI API**
      - File Parsing: **PyPDF2**, **python-docx**

  - **Database:**

      - **PostgreSQL**

## Project Structure

The project is a monorepo containing three distinct services:

```
skillbridge-mvp/
├── client/         # Next.js Frontend
├── server/         # NestJS Backend
├── ai-service/     # Python FastAPI AI Service
└── README.md
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.9 or later)
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  - An active [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd skillbridge-mvp
```

**2. Set Up the Database**

  - Start your PostgreSQL server.
  - Create a new database for the project (e.g., `skillbridge`).

**3. Configure the AI Service**

```bash
cd ai-service

# Create a virtual environment and activate it
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key.

**4. Configure the Backend Server**

```bash
cd ../server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and update the `DATABASE_URL` with your PostgreSQL connection string and verify the `AI_SERVICE_URL`.

**5. Configure the Frontend Client**

```bash
cd ../client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file, verify the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, and set your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL`.

## Running the Application

You will need to run all three services simultaneously in three separate terminal windows.

  - **Terminal 1: Start the AI Service**

    ```bash
    cd ai-service
    source venv/bin/activate
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    # Service will run on http://localhost:8001
    ```

  - **Terminal 2: Start the Backend Server**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run start:dev
    # Service will run on http://localhost:5000
    ```

  - **Terminal 3: Start the Frontend Client**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run dev
    # App will be accessible at http://localhost:3000
    ```

## Environment Variables

Make sure to create a `.env` file in each service directory from the provided `.env.example` files.

  - **`ai-service/.env`**

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    ```

  - **`server/.env`**

    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/skillbridge"
    AI_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8001"
    ```

  - **`client/.env`**

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000/api"
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_random_secret_key_here"
    NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    ```

## Project Roadmap

The current version is a functional end-to-end MVP. The next steps are:

  - [ ] **Database Persistence:** Save all analysis results to the PostgreSQL database, linked to user accounts.
  - [ ] **User Profiles & Dashboard:** Build out user profile pages and a dashboard to view historical analyses and track progress.
  - [ ] **Learning Path Tracking:** Allow users to mark items in their learning path as complete.
  - [ ] **Refine AI Models:** Improve skill extraction and job matching algorithms.
  - [ ] **Deployment:** Deploy all services to a cloud provider (e.g., Vercel, Render, AWS).
